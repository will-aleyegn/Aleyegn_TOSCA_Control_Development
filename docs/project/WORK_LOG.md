### Session Focus
- GUI Development - Phase 1
- Creating basic PyQt6 shell with tab-based navigation
- Setting up widget structure for future HAL integration

---

### Actions Completed This Session

#### 26. Created Basic GUI Shell with PyQt6
**Time:** 18:20-22:23
**What:** Implemented Phase 1 of GUI development plan with tab-based navigation

**Components Created:**
  - src/ui/main_window.py - Main window with 4-tab layout
  - src/ui/widgets/patient_widget.py - Patient selection and session initiation
  - src/ui/widgets/camera_widget.py - Camera feed placeholder with controls
  - src/ui/widgets/treatment_widget.py - Laser power and ring size control
  - src/ui/widgets/safety_widget.py - Safety interlocks and E-stop

**Features:**
  - Tab-based navigation between all main functionality areas
  - Status bar with hardware connection indicators (Camera, Laser, Actuator)
  - Patient ID search and technician ID entry
  - Laser power control (0-2000 mW) with spinbox and slider
  - Ring size control (0-3000 µm) with spinbox and slider
  - START/STOP treatment buttons (disabled by default)
  - Emergency stop button (red, prominent)
  - Hardware interlocks (footpedal, smoothing device, photodiode)
  - Software interlocks (E-stop, power limit, session valid)
  - Safety event log display

**Technical Details:**
  - All methods properly type annotated (-> None, -> int, -> logging.Logger)
  - All __init__() methods typed
  - return_code explicitly typed as int for mypy compliance
  - No unused imports
  - Follows CODING_STANDARDS.md minimal approach
  - Pre-commit hooks all passing (black, flake8, isort, mypy)

**Testing:**
  - ✓ GUI launches successfully
  - ✓ All 4 tabs render correctly
  - ✓ No runtime errors
  - ✓ Status bar displays correctly
  - ✓ All widgets visible and properly laid out

**Commit:** f0faf57
**Result:** SUCCESS - Basic GUI shell operational and ready for HAL integration
**Status:** Phase 1 complete, ready for Phase 2 (HAL integration)
**Next:** Integrate camera HAL or create actuator/laser HAL stubs

## Session Summary

**Total Actions This Session:** 1 major action
**Status:** GUI Shell Phase 1 Complete

**Key Achievement:**
- ✓ PyQt6 main window with 4 functional tabs (Patient, Camera, Treatment, Safety)
- ✓ Complete type annotations (mypy compliant)
- ✓ All pre-commit hooks passing
- ✓ Ready for HAL integration

**Current State:**
- Camera module: ✓ Complete (6 test scripts, all passing)
- GUI shell: ✓ Phase 1 complete (widgets and layout)
- HAL layer: ⏳ Not started
- Integration: ⏳ Ready to begin

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Phase 2 - HAL Integration):
1. Create src/hardware/ directory structure
2. Implement CameraController HAL stub
3. Implement LaserController HAL stub
4. Implement ActuatorController HAL stub
5. Wire up "Connect Camera" button to CameraController
6. Update status bar indicators based on hardware connection

### Phase 3 - Safety System:
1. Implement interlock state management
2. Enable/disable treatment based on safety conditions
3. Emergency stop functionality
4. Safety event logging

### Phase 4 - Patient Management:
1. Database schema for patient records
2. Patient search/lookup functionality
3. Session management (start/stop/validate)
4. Treatment history logging
