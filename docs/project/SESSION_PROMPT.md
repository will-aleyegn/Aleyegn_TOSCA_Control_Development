# New AI Session Prompt Template

I'm working on the TOSCA Medical Laser Control System. This is an FDA-Enhanced Documentation Level medical device project.

**Please do the following:**

1. Read `docs/project/START_HERE.md` for quick setup
2. Read `docs/project/PROJECT_STATUS.md` for complete project state
3. Read `docs/project/CODING_STANDARDS.md` for development rules
4. Check current git status and latest commits
5. Let me know what we were working on and ask if we should continue

**Critical Rules:**
- Write minimal code only (no extras, no decorative elements)
- Always add new packages to requirements.txt
- Test outputs go to designated directories only
- Update docs/project/PROJECT_STATUS.md as we work
- All code must pass pre-commit hooks (Black, Flake8, MyPy, isort)

**After the AI reads the files, continue with your work!**
